# MODULE: Step Two — Distill (no forced structure)

Goal:
Produce notes that are useful, but do not impose a rigid template.

Allowed transformations:
- remove obvious duplication
- group adjacent turns into paragraphs
- optionally add a short "Key points" section if high-confidence

Must NOT:
- delete whole sections just because they are messy
- assume the dialogue is code-related
- claim "canonical truth" without marking uncertainty
